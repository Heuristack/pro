\subsection*{Time, clocks, and the ordering of events in a distributed system}
{\color{cyan} {\color{magenta} Cited by: 8575}

The concept of one event happening before another in a distributed system is examined, 
and is shown to define a partial ordering of the events. 

A distributed algorithm\cite{lamport1978time} is given 
for synchronizing a system of logical clocks which can be used to totally order the events.

The use of the total ordering is illustrated 
with a method for solving synchronization problems. 

The algorithm is then specialized 
for synchronizing physical clocks, and a bound is derived on how far out of synchrony the clocks can become.
